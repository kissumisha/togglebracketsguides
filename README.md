## Description

## How to use

- Toggle the Bracket Guides with `CTRL+SHIFT+B`. (Mac users CMD+SHIFT+B).
- There are 3 states for the setting:
  - Active: will show the guides for the current active bracket pair
  - True: will show the guides for all bracket pair and highlight the current active pair
  - False: guides disabled

## Requirements

- This extension requires VSCode v1.61 or higher. This was the first version of VSCode to include the Bracket Pair Guides.

## Settings Affected

* `editor.guides.bracketpairs`: Active/True/False.
